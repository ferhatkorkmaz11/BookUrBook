## Title
This is a group project that was for Bilkent University's CS 102 course. 
## Description
Since school related materials are very expensive due to economic reasons, we thought of an app that enables students to sell their second-hand school materials on an online platform. In this app, students can either find and buy the necessary material or they can sell the materials that they do not need anymore. This app is focused exclusively on university students so only university students will be able to register and use our app with their edu.tr mail in order to create a much more reliable and trustworthy sales environment.

## The parts that were mostly done by me
-> Database management by using FireBase and Connecting MVC Models with the gotten information from Database for activities with a groupmate. \
-> Login-Register-Logout systems on which only the users with @.edu.tr mails can register with a verification code that are sent to their email.\
-> Setting and displaying the user avatar.\
-> Designing main menu, login, verification, register, and welcome screens.\
-> Implementing the JavaMailAPI into the project in order to send a mail that contains the verification code.\
-> Making wishlist system in database and connecting it to the app properly.\
-> Connecting the admin panel with database.\
-> Developing a proper report system for the posts and chats with a groupmate.\
-> Block system with a groupmate.\
-> Eliminating banned and blocked (by the current user) users' posts from the postlist and wishlist screens with a groupmate.\
-> While registering, it checks more. (Alphanumerical email, password, and username)\
-> Feedback system by using JavaMailAPI.\
-> Resetting password for the users.\
-> Fixing bugs with my group mates.\
